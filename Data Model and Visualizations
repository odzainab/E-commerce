*Figure 4: Shows relationships between the fact table and dimension tables, enabling DAX measures for analysis.*

**Notes:**  
- Fact table connects with Item_Dim, Customer_Dim, Store_Dim, Time_Dim, and Tran_Dim.  
- One-to-many relationships ensure accurate aggregation.  
- Measures such as Total Sales, Total Quantity, Customers, AOV, Domestic vs. International Sales, and YoY Growth are calculated based on this model.
